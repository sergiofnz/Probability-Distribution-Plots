This repository includes a Python script that uses numpy, matplotlib, and scipy 
to visualize common probability distributions: 
Poisson, Exponential, and Normal. Graphs with variation of key parameters (such as λ and σ) 
are presented to facilitate the analysis and understanding of these distributions.
